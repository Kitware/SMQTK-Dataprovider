        Batch the given iterable into ``batch_size`` chunks, calling the given
        ``cursor_callback`` with each batch.

        This is generally intended for when the use of the
        ``cursor.executemany`` function is appropriate for statements other than
        SELECT or VALUES.

        When performing a query with a large number of component elements, the
        time between performing the query and getting the first response can be
        long. Additionally, the whole query would need to be constructed first
        which may take a long time or consume a large amount of memory for large
        iterables.

        Splitting an iterable of elements up into batches lessens the
        construction time and memory foot-print of each individual query. This
        in turn improves the response time for individual queries to the server
        as well as keeping the local memory requirements static. A fast response
        time means that results can be iterated out and errors can be revealed
        more quickly.

        This method handles creating a new connection and cursor, ensuring the
        a table's existence (if that query was set) and pulling together batches
        of the given size from the provided opaque iterable.

        After a successful call to the given callback all result rows are
        yielded. After all calls to the given callback are performed, a

        flush the connection (e.g. for pgbouncer).

        Due to this method optionally yielding values, calling this returns a

            the cursor object for the database connection and the current batch
            elements (list-type). The given batch of elements may be of up to
            size ``batch_size`` or less (the "tail" batch). This function should
            perform ``executemany`` actions on the provided cursor for the given
            batch. Results are optionally yielded af this call successfully
            returns.

            If this callback raises an exception, a rollback is performed on the
            connection and the connection is closed, passing the exception
            forward.
        :param batch_size: Batch size limit when pulling elements from the input
            iterable. May be a positive integer, 0 or None. A value of 0 or None
